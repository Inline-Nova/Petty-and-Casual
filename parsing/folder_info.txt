parsing folder: 

dictionary file is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaleidawave/english-dictionary 
the file contains the word, part of speech, and definition
for the purposes of this project, we don't need the part of speech and definition

in excel: the dictionary.csv is cleaned.
    part of speech and definition column removed
    repeat words removed
    words that have hyphens '-', apostrophes ', and whitespace 

using this cleaned dictionary, we parse through it to get substrings of 2 characters on every 50th word in the csv file 
example: 
    take the word abdicate. we will store ab,bd,di,ic,ca,at,te 

this will be the basis of the game's substring text to play the game
